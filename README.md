# HealtApp

 The application is made for helping the people regarding some notions of healt.

!!!The application can't substitute the medical staff, it is not a disease diagnostic application, so it's only for relative and general proposals!!!

For the moment the is no API for this application(everything is manual), so the result is based only on user input. in the near future the application will be linked to smart watches, medical devices, etc.

First step in "UI", the user enters all the data that the application needs. name, sex, age, height, weight, bpm, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure.

Based on this data, several indices such are indicated to the user: a. as the weight index b. the normal weight at which the user has to reach c. the weight that the user must lose or gain in order to reach the ideal weight d. if the bpm is good or not and whici is the normal BPM based on the: sex and age e. if the blood pressure is good based on the age, sex and weight
